# Nuke_Bot v2.1
This is a newer more powerful version of my previous bot that makes use of the DiscordJS commando framework which can be found at https://github.com/discordjs/Commando.

A few new functions that this bot supports are:

* General functions:
  * A ping command to test response time with the bot and discord servers
  * customizable prefix per guild
  * Added the ability to reload commands without restarting the bot
  * Added Try catch errors to give users information as to why their commands are stupid and didn't work.
  * Added help command which shows all available commands
 
 * Games, The Bot Has a variety of games to play with or against the people in your guild. These games include:
    * 8ball- A discord take on the classic magic 8 ball toy; Example: \*8ball Am I going to win this round?
    * Connect4- You can play this grid based game against other people in your server; Example: \*c4 (then use the emojis to move)
    * Dice- need to roll a dice? use the dice command to get the outcome of a six-sided dice roll; Example: \*Dice
    * Hangman- This is a co-op version of hangman to solve with the entire server; Example: \*hangman (to guess letters add reaction and choose the first letter that shows on search)
   

  * Moderation, These commands are helpful to moderators of the discord
    * Ban- Use this command to ban members from your discord server; Example: \*ban {user}
    * kick- Use this command to kick members from your discord server; Example: \*kick {user}
    * addRole- Use this command to add a role to a user ***Not yet implemented***; Example \*addRole {user} {role}
    
  * Miscellaneous:
    * avatar- Shows your user profile picture with your name if no user is specified it defaults to the sender; Example: \*avatar
